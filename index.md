## 1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting topic covered in this quarter was the immutability property of blockchains. This conecpt is interesting to me becuase it shows the core model of trust in decentralized platforms which plays into our project. Once data is recorded on a blockchain and verified, it cannot be altered or deleted without changing the entire blockchain's history. This is almost impossible due to the distrubited consensus mechanism. The permanence that blockchains provide is powerful for authentication applications like ours.

## 2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
For Quarter 2 I would like to continue developing an academic document request and verification application that uses blockchain technology. We want to design a decentralized system that allows academic institutions and individuals to issue, verify, and request official documents through our smart contract on the Ethereum network.

## 3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
One potential change is to migrate the application to a layer 2 solution such as Polygon or Arbitrum. Although Ethereum provides a well established and secure network for smart contract deployment it has some downsides. Ethereum is slow and costly which creates barriers for scalability and user adoption. By implemeting our application on Polygon or Arbitrum, we can maintain compatibility on the EVM while increasing transaction speed and decreasing transaction fees.

## 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
Implementing a user friendly interface would be important to our project. Most of the users have never interacted with smart contracts or used crypro wallet before. Designing a user friendly and intuitive UI would help bridge the gap between blockchain infrastructure and academic credential management systems.
